# FCI Learning Management System (FCI LMS)
**It's a Responsive Learning Management System, It is Fully Automating the Learning Process at the Collage by Providing Basic & Advanced Features for Students, Lecturers and Admins, It Can Be Considered a Bit Closer to the Moodle Platform**.

# Basic Info
* This System was my Graduation Project (Faculty of Computers & Information).
* I've Worked on the Server-Side and also Some Tasks on the Client-Side Related to the Responsiveness.
* This Project Took about One Year to Be Completely Finished during my Last Academic Year.
* I've Learnt Many Skills from this Project Specially on the Server-Side Using PHP & MySQL DB.
* I was Graded by "Excellent" for this App.

# Description
* The App This Will Focus on Automating the Learning Process in the Collage.
* There Will Be Three Kinds Of Users For That Website System.
* The First of Them Is The Admin(s) Who Will Be an Employee In The College.
* The Second Is The Lecturers and The Third Is The Students.
* The App's Usage will Be Private for Only the Lecturers and Students of the Collage.
* In Other Words, It Cannot Be Signed Up from Anyone Outside The Collage, The Thing We Intend To Do By Making The Admin Add The Basic Info For Either The Student or The Lecturer Who Want To Sign Up Like Their First Names, Second Names and Some Specific Info Like the Department For The Lecturer and The ID For The Student, Then The Lecturer or Student Will Use This Info Added By The Admin To Sign Up Besides Some Other Info That Will Be Required In The Signing Up Form Like Their Passwords Which Will Be Added By Their Own Not By The Admin.
